<p>This is an `aside`, a useful place to put information of any kind: metadata about the site author (with or without pictures), brief information about the purposes of the site, a static collection of external links or anything else.</p>
<p>For some Classless themes pictures and data about the author may suit better in the `cover` and `description` site attributes (see `config.toml`), but most of the times that kind of information will fit here better.</p>
